# Yahtzee online
Just me trying to recreate yahtzee as a small project.

## Setup for use
Navigate to the src folder and run a php server.
Please note that this app does not work when started from the file-directory
due to the use of JavaScript.
```shell
# Navigate to src folder and run localhost
cd src
# If php is not in your local variables, use "<path>/php.exe" instead
php -S localhost:<port>
```
Open your webbrowser and navigate to `localhost:<port>` and index.html will be loaded.
